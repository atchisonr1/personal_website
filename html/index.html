                    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Reagan Atchison, and I am currently attending Northern Kentucky University. I am completing my final semester, and will graduate this May. I will be graduating with a B.S. in Business Information Systems, along with a minor in Business. I currently work at Alltech, Inc. in Nicholasville, Kentucky as a Business Administration Intern.</p>
                    <p>I am currently looking for a full-time position in data analytics in the Cincinnati, OH or Northern Kentucky area. I hope to have a job lined up before I graduate, if not soon after. If you know of any positions that you think would be a good fit for me, please feel free to reach out to me; you can find my contact information on the right of this page.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy golfing, hiking, and playing video games. As you will see, I am a huge pop punk and 80's rock fan. I also love playing with my two pets, Zoobie and Little. I hope you learn a little bit about me as you navigate through my website!</p>
