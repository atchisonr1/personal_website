                <h2><b><u>Golfing</u></b></h2>
                <p>In my free time, I absolutely love to play golf. It is starting to look like spring in Northern Kentucky, and I couldn't be happier. I started playing golf in high school, and I played for the girls' team at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, Kentucky. I got the chance to play golf all over the Commonwealth. After I graduated high school, I went on to play golf on the womens' team at Georgetown College for two years. There, I got the chance to play even more courses around the south-eastern side of the United States. On the right, you'll see a picture of me playing in a golf tournament in Florida. Below, I have a few of my favorite courses listed (in no particular order).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dale Hollow Lake State Park Golf Course in Burkesville, Kentucky</li>
                    <li>Stonecrest Golf Course in Prestonsburg, Kentucky</li>
                    <li>Kearney Hill Golf Links in Lexington, Kentucky</li>
                    <li>Connemara Golf Course in Nicholasville, Kentucky</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2><b><u>Hiking</u></b></h2>
                    <p>Another activity I like doing in my free time is hiking. I have been to Natural Bridge State Park in Slade, Kentucky more times than I can count. I enjoy hiking because it is great exercise and it is fun to do with other people. My fianc√©e and I also enjoy going to Gatlinburg, Tennessee and hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains. My friends and I have gone to many places to go hiking. On the right, you'll see a picture of my friend Jordan and I after we got to the top of a mountain near Morehead, Kentucky.</p>

                    <h2><b><u>Playing Video Games</u></b></h2>
                    <p>If I am not able to do activities outside, I find entertainment in playing video games. I currently have a Nintendo Switch but I also enjoy playing older systems as well. My favorite system is the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but the Nintendo 64 is a close runner-up. Yoshi is my favorite character, and the games that include him are some of my favorites. Below, you will find an ordered list of my all-time favorite video games.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Yoshi's Story for the Nintendo 64</li>
                        <li>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island for the SNES</li>
                        <li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch</li>
                        <li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 for the Xbox 360</li>
