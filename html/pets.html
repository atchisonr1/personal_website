                    <h2><u>Zoobie</u></h2>
                    <p>Zoobie is our eight year-old Australian Cattle Dog. As a Blue Heeler, she has a ton of energy and requires a lot of attention. Along with her constant walks and playtime, she also requires a lot of rest. As soon as she eats her dinner at 6pm, she goes straight to bed! She knows that the early bird catches the worm, so since she goes to bed so early, she is up at 3am and ready to start the day. Zoobie is a girl with many talents; she knows how to sit, stand up, beg, speak, shake, lay down, play dead, roll over, crawl and more. Zoobie sure is one smart cookie!</p>

                    <h2><u>Little</u></h2>
                    <p>Little is a grey tabby cat and he is only six months old. He also has a lot of energy, and loves playing with a toy that we call "spinny ball." Little may be small, but he is like a bull in a China shop because he will knock everything off of... well, anything. He loves to push the soap into the sink or knock things off of your desk when no one is looking. No one taught him how, but he knows how to speak, especially if you are eating or if you are anywhere near the kitchen. Little's favorite pastime is knocking every and any thing off of the kitchen counter.</p>
